## Project: A Certification Management Contract

The idea is to create an intelligent Solidity contract enabling an institution (such as a university or training organization) to issue digital diplomas to students. This contract will enable :

- The addition and management of certifications by an institution (admin).
- Consultation of certifications by students.
- Use of structures (struct), mappings (mapping), modifiers (modifier) and functions (function).
- Access control with modifiers (onlyAdmin).
- Input validation with require to avoid errors and fraud.
