# Assignment

- Write a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the use of data types, a constructor, modifiers, functions, mappings, structs, and error handling. Your contract should have a real-world use case but must not be a SetterGetter contract, Count Increment contract, or Simple Storage contract. 

- Implement proper access control using modifiers and validate inputs with require statements. Deploy and verify the contract on Sepolia using Hardhat. 

- Everyone will pull from the organisation and push into Week 3 day 5 assignment folder, then make a PR. 
- Also create a README explaining the implementation, and a brief report on how each concept was used.

**Submission time 2:30AM, the form will be dropped by 2 and you should have made your PR by then.**
