# Voting System Smart Contract

The contract allows the owner to add candidates, and users can vote for their preferred candidates. The contract demonstrates the use of data types, structs, mappings, modifiers, functions, and error handling.

## Features
1. **Access Control**: Only the owner can add candidates.
2. **Vote Once**: Each address can vote only once.
3. **Input Validation**: Ensures candidate names are not empty and candidate IDs are valid.
4. **Data Storage**: Uses structs to store candidate details and mappings to track voters activities i.e checking if they have casted vote or not.
