# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/BallotModule.ts
```
# Hardhat deployment

The Contract Address deployed to is  0x25E4220B0F20653683DcAD5B8d9Bf5D6FEbE2731
